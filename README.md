This project is an introductory machine learning project in which I develop a machine which uses data from prior Olympics to predict the number of medals won in the next olympics.

The project is programmed entirely in python, incorporating several machine learning packages such as:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn


In the .zip folder you will find two files,
* Predictor.py     - The python file containig the program
* teams.csv        - The sheet containing all team data
