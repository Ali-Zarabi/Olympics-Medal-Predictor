# Project Overview
This project is an introductory machine learning project in which I develop a machine which uses data from prior Olympics to predict the number of medals won in the next olympics.

## Python Packages Packages
The project is programmed entirely in python, incorporating several machine learning packages such as:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

## File overview
In the .zip folder you will find two files,
* Predictor.py     - The python file containing the program
* teams.csv        - The sheet containing all team data

Thank you !
